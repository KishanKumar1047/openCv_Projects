# 👁️ OpenCV Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Computer Vision projects using OpenCV**.  
Each project demonstrates the power of image processing, facial recognition, and object detection with practical and fun implementations.

## 📂 Projects Included

1. **Cartooning an Image**  
   - Transform a real photo into a cartoon-like image.  
   - Techniques: edge detection, bilateral filtering, and image masking.  

2. **Count Total Faces**  
   - Detect and count the number of faces in an image or real-time webcam feed.  
   - Haar Cascade / DNN-based face detection used.  

3. **Identify Gender**  
   - Gender classification using facial features.  
   - Models: Pre-trained CNN / OpenCV DNN module.  

4. **Mr. X (Invisible Cloak Project 🧙‍♂️)**  
   - Inspired by Harry Potter’s *Invisible Cloak*.  
   - Background subtraction + color detection makes the cloak invisible in real-time video.  
   - Steps: capture background → detect cloak color (e.g., red/blue) → replace with background.  

5. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**  
   - Extract text from images using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR.  
   - Applications: digitizing scanned documents, number plate recognition, etc.

- **Libraries & Tools**
  - OpenCV  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - pytesseract (for OCR)  
  - Pre-trained models (Haar cascades, DNNs)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/KishanKumar1047/openCv_Projects
   cd opencv-projects
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run any project**

   ```bash
   python project_name.py
   ```

## 📊 Workflow in Each Project

* Data capture (image/video input)
* Preprocessing (resizing, grayscale, filtering, thresholding)
* Applying OpenCV algorithms/models
* Output visualization (real-time / static results)

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* [ ] Add emotion recognition system.
* [ ] Implement object tracking in real-time.
* [ ] Deploy OCR as a web app.
